title: Function Arguments
---

The link:getting-started.html[Getting Started] page showed how Rook can not only
invoke your function, but pass it specific data needed by the function. 
So far, we've just seen that keywords in the request path can be provided as arguments.

That's just the tip of of the iceberg.
Rook is designed so that you can write your resource handler function as pure functions
footnote:[Pure in the sense of not relying on globals, not pure as in "side effect free".]
The goal here is to make you code testable and agile.

Rook uses a set of naming conventions and metdata to determine the value to
in each argument to your function. This is called _argument resolution_.

Deep down, the standard case is that each argument will be resolved as a function applied
to the Ring request; this usually means getting a key from the map, or navigating a
path starting from the Ring request. 

The trick, of course, is to ensure that the _correct_ argument resolver function is identified (or constructed) for each argument.

Let's start with the some default behaviors.

== Path Keywords

Arguments whose name matches a keyword in the path resolve to the value from the path, as a string. This is a route parameter, and the values are stored as a map in the Ring request as :route-params.

== Convention Names

The name of the argument itself may be all Rook needs to resolve the argument.

.Convention Names
|===
|Argument Symbol |Argument Value

|request
|The Ring request map.

|params
|The contents of the Ring request :params key. This contains all submitted query and form parameters.

|params*
|Same as params, but with the top-level keys 'Clojureized' footnote:[Embedded underscore are converted to dashes, e.g. :user_id to :user-id. This can be convienient when exposing
a resource designed to be easily accessible using JSON and client-side JavaScript.]

|resource-uri
|The URI for the namespace containing the function. See the notes on
link:resource-uri.html[calculating the Resource URI].
|===

TIP: It is ok to use map destructuring on an argument, but then you must use the :as key to identify its name, so that Rook can determine the argument's name, for determining argument resolution.

.Example
[source,clojure]
----
(defn index [{:keys [page sort per-page] :as params}]
  ...)
----

Here, Rook uses the argument's name, params, to determine what to inject (the :params key of the Ring request map).
The argument is destructured to get the individual query parameters passed in the request.


The set of supported convention names is extensible using the :arg-symbol->resolver key in the options map passed to namespace-handler.


== Argument Tagging

Another way to specify argument resolution is with metadata tags. The presence of the tag indicate a particular resolution (the value is ignored, but is usually the constant true).

.Metadata Tags
|===
|Tag |Argument Value

|:request
|The Ring request itself. The name of the argument is ignored.

|:request-key
|The argument symbol is converted to a keyword, 
 the resolved value is the value in the Ring request map for that key.

|:header
|The argument symbol is converted to a string, and used to access a value in the :headers map of the Ring request.

|:param
|The argument value is converted to a keyword, and used to access a value in the :params map of the Ring request.

|:injection
|The argument value is converted to a keyword, and used to access an link:injection.html[injection] associated with the Ring request.

|:resource-uri
|The argument is resolved to the containing namespace's link:resource-uri.html[resource URI].

|===

.Example

[source,clojure]
----
(defn index
  [id
   ^:header if-modified-since
   ^:injection db-connection]
   ...)
----

In this example, the id argument is resolved from a route param (because the convention route for functions named 'index' has a :id keyword).  The link:http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.25[if-modified-since] argument is a header (with matching name), and the db-connection parameter is a injected value. We'll discuss how to link:injection.html[configure injection] in a later section.

WARNING: You should have at most one of these tags on any single parameter; having multiple
will result in a runtime exception.

The set of supported metadata tags is extensible using the :resolver-factories key in the options map passed to namespace-handler.

== Argument Resolver Metadata

An argument may have metadata with key :io.aviso.rook/resolver.

The value for this metadata is either a keyword from the list of Metadata tags _or_ an
argument resolver function.

This feature is not used very often.

== Namespace Argument Resolver Metadata

The namespace may define a map used to identify argument resolvers, as key :arg-resolvers.

The keys of this map are symbols; the values for the map are either a tag keyword, or an
argument resolver function.

In this way, a common argument used in many resource handler functions can have its
argument resolution strategy defined once. In the example above, the if-modified-since argument may appear in multiple functions, and would only need to be linked as a :header
once.

.Example
[source,clojure]
----
(ns org.example.users
  "Rook resource for accessing users."
  {:arg-resolvers 
    {if-modified-since :header
     db-connection :injection}})

(defn index 
  [id if-modified-since db-connection] 
  ...)     
----

== Resolver Priority

Finding the argument resolver for an argument involves checks in the following order:

* The :io.aviso.rook/resolver metadata on the argument
* The function's :arg-resolvers metadata footnote:[Remember, the namespace's metadata is merged into the fucntion's]
* By metadata tag
* By convention name
* As a route parameter

WARNING: Each argument to a request handler function *must* have an argument resolver or an exception will
be thrown when constructing the namespace handler.
