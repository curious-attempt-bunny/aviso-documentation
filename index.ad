Documentation is currently being generated and converted. In addition, Rook

At http://www.aviso.io/[Aviso] we're excited to use Clojure, and excited to
contibute back as much as we can as open source.

All of our libraries use the Apache Software License 2.0.

This growing suite of tools is part of our standard toolbelt when building applications
in Clojure.
